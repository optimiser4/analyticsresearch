# Objective of study

The purpose of this study was to obtain additional information and insights about marketing analytics, using surveys.

Why focus on surveys?
New tools that succeed in a particular field are often those that solve a particular problem or offer an easier method of achieving goals that has not yet been adequately addressed by majority of tools on the market. 

Even if the new tool has most features offered by other tools, one or two differentiating features of such kind can often lead to faster adoption by the clients. 

Survey are excellent sources of information in identifying areas where users are encountering difficulties with current tools or areas which present a substantial concern for them. 

Additional survey benefit is providing time evolution of topics. If the survey is showing that a certain area of concern is being addressed and its importance decreasing then it presents an important information for a new developer to not focus on a problem whose importance is already being diminished. 

# 2. Surveys

2.1 The State of Influencer Marketing 2019 : Benchmark Report 

I will first address the influencer marketing survey from Influencer Marketing Hub. Full report can be download here: 
https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-2019-benchmark-report/ 

I will focus only on segments from survey that are relevant in the context discussed in section 1. 

Influencer fraud 
Influencer marketing fraud is a concern to 64% of our survey respondents. This is because 63% of respondents have personally experienced influencer marketing fraud in their campaigns. 

The 64% share is relatively high and indicates that fake follower detection (as mentioned in Inflo project description) could be an important future feature that users may be motivated to pay extra as it could address their concerns. 

The interest in area is also indicated by monthly visits number from Similarweb analytics for Hypeauditor when compared with other major tools or sites in field: 

Website	Monthly visits (June 2019)*
Hypeauditor	646K
Neoreach	171K
Influencermarketinghub	1.89M
Buzzsumo	1.07M
Upfluence	171K

Majority find influencer discovery moderately difficult

18% of respondents consider selection of appropriate influencers to be very difficult, while only 20% of respondents consider influencer selection easy. Majority of respondents consider the problem of finding suitable influencers to be of medium difficulty.

Although this issue seems to be diminishing in importance (with influx of new tools) in recent period it indicates that a new, simpler and better way of finding influencers could make an important differentiation in later phases of the project. 

Concern about brand safety

Nearly half (49%) of respondents believe brand safety can occasionally be a concern when running an influencer marketing campaign. 30% gave a more definitive belief that brand safety is always a concern.

In another similar major survey – The 2019 State of Influencer Marketing Report by Global Marketing Influencer Marketing Agency Relatable (see later sections below) 84.4% of marketers consider brand safety to be a concern on some level, with nearly 40% saying it’s always a concern. 

# Keep your brand safe with due diligence of influencers 
Each influencer is audited by scanning their posts as well as comments for profanity words, adult content, violence related words. Influencer can be then tagged correspondingly and include this category in filters. 

In later versions due diligence based on text could be supplemented with one that also uses image analysis. 

# Majority Believe Influencer Marketing Can be Automated, although Significant Numbers Disagree
Survey shows that 57% believe in the automation process. However, a sizable minority, 43%, don’t think that automation can result in successful influencer marketing.
I see this as people receptive to some kind of digital assistant in this field that could automate several or all steps in the processes in influencer marketing. Probably way too early at the moment but worth keeping in mind. 

# 2/3 of Influencer Marketing Campaigns are Campaign Based
Survey findings: there is a trend towards brands cultivating more long-term relationships with influencers.
A new category or tag could be defined offering the searchers additional filter – to search for influencers already engaging in long-term campaigns. 

# 2.2 The 2019 State of Influencer Marketing Report 
Second survey to be addressed is from Global Influencer Marketing Agency Relatable. Report is accessible at:

I will focus only on segments from survey that are relevant in the context discussed in section 1. 

76% of marketing teams are operating their influencer marketing manually without any tools. 
This along with many other indicators shows there is potential for growth in the tools segment. 

4 out of 10 marketing teams having little to no experience with influencer marketing. 

Case study of tremendous success of this approach in a similar field: 
I started in SEO in 2007 and the major players at the time were Majestic (founded 2004) and Moz (founded 2004). In 2011, 7 years later than the aforementioned two, Ahrefs was founded and in the last years it really seems that it overtook them. So what is their secret of success? They actually published what they did differently that could explain their rise, sources:
https://medium.com/ahrefs-marketing/how-we-grew-traffic-to-ahrefs-blog-by-1136-and-got-thousands-of-paying-customers-1fbd7e6b145a 
https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/ahrefs-content-strategy/#gref 

They focused on 1) writing topics people search about and are related to their tools, 2) related topics with high business potential and 3) they wrote articles educating users how they can solve their problems with ahrefs tools.
And they also got a virtuous cycle - people shared the interesting posts, they got links, higher rankings and more sharing.
Given the results of survey on influencer marketing about little experience for almost half of respondents, an approach similar to ahrefs could lead to great results. 

# Brand safety
44.8% responds “Occasionally” when asked “Would you consider Brand Safety a concern when running an Influencer Marketing campaign?”, with almost an equal share (39.6%) responding “Always”. Only 15.6% says “Not Really”. 

# Insights from analysis of similar tools
Competitor analysis is one of the methods I employ to better understand the industry when working on project proposal. 

I will concentrate just on features that I found to be of interest. 
AspireIQ
Quickmatch feature where you get suggestions based on your preferences (probably based on recommendation engine) seems fun to work with. Select or skip. 
Watchlist seems interesting – if I understand correctly, you set your competitors and the engine returns influencers that mention them. 
Search by image (as you already mentioned in your specification). 
NeoReach
Another with recommendation engine. 
Tagger Media 
Requires opt-in for influencers. Strategically interesting as less dependent on whims of Instagram in terms of access. 
Upfluence
Interesting idea is the ability to use relative weighting for each keyword when searching.
Also offering management of lists that are result of search queries.  
Advanced social listening features – set up hashtags collection / specific influencers / competitors and mixing of them to monitor specific streams. 
Julius
Ability to compare influencers against each other (up to five). 
Influencer page shows interests in form of tags. Like biking, etc. Clicking on interest shows you specific posts on interest. Would probably not be too hard to train a similar classifier. 
Showing in a nice graphic way on what day/time are historically highest engagements, i.e. when is best to post content with this influencer. 
 Mavrck
Unique angle – turn existing customers in influencers.
